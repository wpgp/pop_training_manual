Welcome to *WorldPop Population Modelling Training Manual, vol I*. This is an open book designed to provide in-depth guide and understanding to researchers and users of WorldPop small area population datasets on how the underlying statistical methods are developed and implemented across various contexts. It complements the *WorldPop Book of Methods* by going a step further to demonstrate the step-by-step processes of ‘how-to-do’ rather than ‘how-it-is-done’ by providing relevant background knowledge and practical examples.
The manual which was developed by the WorldPop Research Group within the School of Geography and Environmental Science at the University of Southampton, is made up of 11 modules tailored to meet the needs of diverse audience. Although mainly based on R statistical programming language, the manual is designed to accommodate users at various levels of expertise and backgrounds by including very basics of R and statistical methods, in addition to more complex methodologies within the later modules.
